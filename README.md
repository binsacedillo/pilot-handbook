## Technical Log: Why Client-Side Data Fetching?

All dashboard data fetching was moved to the client (via tRPC hooks) to address issues with Next.js App Router's soft-navigation and React Query hydration. This ensures:
- Real-time reactivity and instant updates after navigation or mutations.
- Consistent, up-to-date data for all dashboard widgets, regardless of navigation method.
- Simpler cache invalidation and error handling, especially for authenticated/protected data.

This is now the standard for all dashboard and user-specific data modules.

# Technical Decision: Resilient Data Architecture

**Compliance**: Implemented a non-destructive soft-delete system for both Users and Aircraft, ensuring historical flight data remains intact even when accounts are deactivated (FAA/CAA friendly).

**UX/Performance**: Shifted to client-side tRPC data fetching with pre-defined loading skeletons, eliminating stale-data flashes during Next.js navigation and improving perceived performance (LCP) on the dashboard.

# Pilot Handbook

A comprehensive flight logging and pilot management application built with the T3 Stack. Pilot Handbook helps pilots track their flight hours, manage aircraft, and maintain accurate logbook records while providing administrative tools for flight schools and organizations.


## 🚀 Key Features

### ✈️ Pilot Tools
* **Smart Flight Logging:** Automated duration calculation and aircraft tracking.
* **Live Weather Widget:** Real-time METAR data with airport name resolution.
* **Dynamic Filtering:** Filter logs by aircraft type using URL-based state (shareable links).
* **Recency Tracking:** 90-Day currency monitoring (Day/Night/IFR).

### 🛡️ Admin & Security
* **Role-Based Access:** Admin dashboard for user verification and management.
* **Secure Auth:** Clerk integration with "In-App Browser" detection for TikTok/Instagram users.
* **Data Integrity:** Server-side validation with Zod schemas.



## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Core**
* **Framework:** Next.js 16 (App Router)
* **Language:** TypeScript
* **Library:** React 19 (Server Components & Actions)
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4

### Folder Explanations

- **/app**: Main Next.js App Router. Each subfolder is a route (e.g., `/admin` is the admin dashboard, `/flights` is the logbook UI).
```

## 🏁 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** 20+
- **pnpm** (recommended) or npm
- **PostgreSQL** database (Supabase, Neon, or local)

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd pilothandbook
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pnpm install
```

### 3. Set Up the Database
```bash
pnpm prisma db push
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following keys:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_publishable_key
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_clerk_secret_key
DATABASE_URL=your_postgres_connection_string
CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_clerk_webhook_secret
```

### 5. Clerk Setup Tip
> **Important:** In your Clerk Dashboard, go to **User Settings > Metadata** and enable **Public Metadata**. This is required for the `ADMIN` role and other user roles to work correctly in the app.

### 6. Start the Development Server
```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app.
